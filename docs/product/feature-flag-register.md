# Feature flag register

> Live registry of every `FeatureFlag` row in the database, plus the
> rationale for each. Per **D036** every flag must be listed here
> alongside its purpose, default state, and rollout / TTL plan.
>
> The discipline (D036, abridged):
>
> 1. Every new feature lands with `enabledGlobally=false`. Default OFF.
> 2. Every flag declares its `purpose`. Generic flags rejected in review.
> 3. Rollout flags must have `ttl_remove_after`. Default: 90 days.
> 4. Kill switches are permanent and have a named owner.
> 5. No nested flags. If a feature needs two flags, the feature is too big.
> 6. Flags evaluated server-side. Clients never see flag names.
> 7. Every flag flip is audit-logged: who, when, old state, new state, reason.
> 8. Test suite must cover feature behaviour in both states.

## Active flags

| Name               | Purpose | Default (prod)         | Default (dev) | TTL / owner     | Notes                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ------- | ---------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ff_reactions`     | rollout | enabled (post-rollout) | ON            | TTL: 2026-09-01 | Quiet, multi-select reactions on posts. BU-reactions / D050. Live since BU-reactions shipped.  |
| `ff_comments`      | rollout | enabled (post-rollout) | ON            | TTL: 2026-09-01 | Post-detail page + flat comment thread. BU-comments / D052. Live since BU-comments shipped.    |
| `calendar_enabled` | rollout | OFF                    | ON            | TTL: 2026-10-30 | Calendar tab + agenda + month surfaces. BU-calendar-view (downstream of BU-event-time / D073). |

## Flag rationale

### `calendar_enabled`

- **Build unit:** BU-calendar-view (consumes the flag). Schema +
  composer + edit + PostCard surfaces ship in **BU-event-time / D073**
  evergreen — they are NOT gated behind the flag.
- **What it gates:** the `/calendar` route, the calendar tab in
  `AppNav`, and the agenda + month views. Members in production see
  the structured event-time data on PostCards regardless; the flag
  only controls whether the dedicated calendar surface is reachable.
- **Default OFF in prod:** the agenda surface needs real-world testing
  with a non-trivial event volume before we expose it to all members.
  Coordinator preview goes first; gradual rollout follows.
- **Default ON in dev:** the seed (BU-event-time) plants ~8 future
  events so dev / preview can render a non-empty calendar from day
  one.
- **TTL:** 2026-10-30 (six months from registration). At TTL the flag
  is either fully rolled out (and removed) or the owner extends it
  with a named reason. The weekly cron opens an issue at TTL-7d.
- **Audit:** flag-flip rows captured in `audit_log` per D036 §7.

### `ff_reactions`

- **Build unit:** BU-reactions (D050).
- **What it gates:** the reaction pill on PostCard / detail and the
  comment-reaction surface that arrived in BU-comments-reactions.
- **Status:** rolled out, kept on for the foreseeable future. The
  flag stays in the registry as the kill-switch path if a feed
  problem needs to disable reactions across the live system.

### `ff_comments`

- **Build unit:** BU-comments (D052).
- **What it gates:** the post-detail page (`/post/[id]`) and its
  comment thread + composer.
- **Status:** rolled out, kept on. Same kill-switch rationale as
  `ff_reactions`.

## How to register a new flag

1. Add a row to the **Active flags** table above with: name,
   purpose (rollout / kill_switch / pilot_gate), prod + dev defaults,
   TTL or owner, one-sentence note.
2. Add a "Flag rationale" section below explaining what gates,
   why it's needed, and the rollout plan.
3. Land the migration (or the seed in dev) that creates the
   `FeatureFlag` row with `enabledGlobally=false` (or `true` if the
   dev default is ON).
4. Wire the flag check via `server/services/flags.isFeatureEnabled`.
5. Test both states.
6. The PR description must call out the new flag explicitly so review
   catches generic / nested / un-TTL'd flags.

## Removed / expired flags

(none yet — all current flags are active. Removed flags should be
listed here with date + reason for the audit trail.)
